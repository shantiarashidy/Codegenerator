# Python Code Generator using OpenAI API

This project allows users to generate Python code based on textual prompts using OpenAI's GPT-3 model. The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, where users can input a description of the code they want to generate. The generated code is displayed in a scrollable output area.

## Features

- **Textual prompt input**: Users can enter a prompt to specify the code they want to generate.
- **Python code generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate Python code based on the user's input.
- **Tkinter GUI**: A simple graphical interface that allows users to interact with the tool easily.
- **Code output display**: Generated Python code is displayed in a scrollable text area.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openai` Python package (for interacting with the OpenAI API)
- `tkinter` (for the graphical user interface)

## Installation
